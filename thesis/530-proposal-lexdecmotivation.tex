\begin{document}
\maketitle

Much research has investigated perceptual learning, the process whereby listeners exposed to a novel speech pattern from an unfamiliar speaker.  A listener's perceptual system shifts rapidly; for instance, vowel perception can shift solely on the basis of the vowels in a  preceding sentence \citep{LadefogedBroadbent1957}.  Boundaries between fricative categories can be changed by exposure to relatively small amount of ambiguous tokens, but they must be associated with a lexical item \citep{NorrisEtAl2003}.

However, besides the categorical distinction separating words from nonwords, little is known about the factors that influence linking an shifted or ambiguous production of a sound with a category through a lexical item.  Most studies looking at boundaries between fricative categories use lexical items ending with a fricative.
