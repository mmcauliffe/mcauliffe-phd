abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal unfolding of local acoustic information and sentence context using both cross-modal interference (CMI) and word-monitoring tasks. The timing of sentence context effects have important theoretical implications for models of language processing (e.g., initial context independence vs. initial interaction). Yet, different tasks tend to yield different results. For both experiments, stimuli from an acoustically manipulated "goat-to-coat" continuum were embedded in sentences whose interpretation was biased toward either "goat" or "coat." In experiment 1 (CMI), the primary task was listening to sentences for comprehension; the interference task was a word/nonword decision to an unrelated visual probe that appeared at one of three positions within the sentence. Results showed immediate effects of the acoustic manipulation, but only delayed effects of sentence context. These results were interpreted to indicate that phonological processing is initially context-independent but is followed by rapid context integration. Experiment 2 used a word-monitoring task: Response times were significantly longer when sentence context was incongruent with the monitoring target, showing an immediate effect of context. The apparently contradictory results of the two experiments together support an account of language processing in which phoneme categorization is initially independent of sentence context unless an explicit judgment about the identity of the target is required.},

abstract = {This study examined the effect of sentence context and local acoustic structure on phoneme categorization. Target stimuli from a 10-step GOAT-COAT continuum, differing only on a temporal cue for voice onset time (VOT), were embedded in carrier sentences that biased interpretation toward either "goat" or "coat." While subjects listened to the sentences they also responded as quickly as possible to a visual probe by indicating whether the probe matched the target stimulus they heard. Results showed that the interaction of VOT and sentence context significantly affected both identification and RT for stimuli near the perceptual boundary; the identification function showed a boundary shift in favor of the biased context and peak response times for each context reflected the shifted identification boundaries. In addition, response times were faster for identification of stimuli near the category boundary when responses were congruent, rather than incongruent with the sentence context. The response time differences for congruent versus incongruent responses in the boundary region are interpreted as depending on the results of initial phonological analysis; potentially ambiguous categorizations may be subject to additional evaluation in which a context-congruent response is both preferred and available earlier.},

abstract = {Word frequency is the most important variable in research on word processing and memory. Yet, the main criterion for selecting word frequency norms has been the availability of the measure, rather than its quality. As a result, much research is still based on the old Kucera and Francis frequency norms. By using the lexical decision times of recently published megastudies, we show how bad this measure is and what must be done to improve it. In particular, we investigated the size of the corpus, the language register on which the corpus is based, and the definition of the frequency measure. We observed that corpus size is of practical importance for small sizes (depending on the frequency of the word), but not for sizes above 16-30 million words. As for the language register, we found that frequencies based on television and film subtitles are better than frequencies based on written sources, certainly for the monosyllabic and bisyllabic words used in psycholinguistic research. Finally, we found that lemma frequencies are not superior to word form frequencies in English and that a measure of contextual diversity is better than a measure based on raw frequency of occurrence. Part of the superiority of the latter is due to the words that are frequently used as names. Assembling a new frequency norm on the basis of these considerations turned out to predict word processing times much better than did the existing norms (including Kucera \& Francis and Celex). The new SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEX(US) corpus are freely available for research purposes from http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental, as well as from the University of Ghent and Lexique Web sites.},

abstract = {This study explored the interaction between semantic predictability and regional dialect variation in an analysis of speech produced by college-aged female talkers from the Northern, Midland, and Southern dialects of American English. Previous research on the effects of semantic predictability has shown that vowels in high semantic predictability contexts are temporally and spectrally reduced compared to vowels in low semantic predictability contexts. In the current study, an analysis of vowel duration confirmed temporal reduction in the high predictability condition. An analysis of vowel formant structure and vowel space dispersion revealed overall spectral reduction for the Southern talkers. For the Northern talkers, more extreme Northern Cities shifting occurred in the high predictability condition than in the low predictability condition. No effects of semantic predictability were observed for the Midland talkers. These findings suggest an interaction between semantic and indexical factors in vowel reduction processes.},

Two experiments are reported that investigated temporal constraints on perceptual/lexical ambiguity resolution. The results suggest that commitment to a single lexical hypothesis occurs within a relatively small window of time. When information relevant to selection of the contextually appropriate word is not forthcoming within six syllables, commitment to a single lexical hypothesis is delayed but proceeds without benefit from sentence context. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that in addition to temporal constraints, a short independent clause promotes early commitment to a single lexical hypothesis. The findings are discussed in terms of assumptions of current auditory word recognition models.},

Although much research has been devoted to figuring out how listeners deal with variability, virtually none (outside of sociolinguistics) has focused on the source of the variation itself. The current experiments explore whether different kinds of variation lead to different cognitive and behavioral adjustments. Specifically, we compare adjustments to the same acoustic consequence when it is due to context-independent variation (resulting from articulatory properties unique to a speaker) versus context-conditioned variation (resulting from common articulatory properties of speakers who share a dialect). The contrasting results for these two cases show that the source of a particular acoustic-phonetic variation affects how that variation is handled by the perceptual system. We also show that changes in perceptual representations do not necessarily lead to changes in production.},

abstract = {Recent work on perceptual learning shows that listeners' phonemic representations dynamically adjust to reflect the speech they hear (Norris, McQueen, \& Cutler, 2003). We investigate how the perceptual system makes such adjustments, and what (if anything) causes the representations to return to their pre-perceptual learning settings. Listeners are exposed to a speaker whose pronunciation of a particular sound (either /s/ or /integral/) is ambiguous (e.g., halfway between /s/ and /integral/). After exposure, participants are tested for perceptual learning on two continua that range from /s/ to /integral/, one in the Same voice they heard during exposure, and one in a Different voice. To assess how representations revert to their prior settings, half of Experiment 1's participants were tested immediately after exposure; the other half performed a 25-min silent intervening task. The perceptual learning effect was actually larger after such a delay, indicating that simply allowing time to pass does not cause learning to fade. The remaining experiments investigate different ways that the system might unlearn a person's pronunciations: listeners hear the Same or a Different speaker for 25 min with either: no relevant (i.e., 'good') /s/ or /integral/ input (Experiment 2), one of the relevant inputs (Experiment 3), or both relevant inputs (Experiment 4). The results support a view of phonemic representations as dynamic and flexible, and suggest that they interact with both higher- (e.g., lexical) and lower-level (e.g., acoustic) information in important ways.},

In the case of speech, the puzzle is that little reliable acoustic invariance seems to exist. We tested the hypothesis that speech-perception processes recover invariants not about the signal, but rather about the source that produced the signal. Findings from two manipulations suggest that the system learns those properties of speech that result from idiosyncratic characteristics of the speaker; the same properties are not learned when they can be attributed to incidental factors. We also found evidence for how the system determines what is characteristic: In the absence of other information about the speaker, the system relies on episodic order, representing those properties present during early experience as characteristic of the speaker. This "first-impressions" bias can be overridden, however, when variation is an incidental consequence of a temporary state (a pen in the speaker's mouth), rather than characteristic of the speaker.},

An e'qleriment has been carried out which shows that the linguistic information con- veyed by a vowel sound does not depend on the absolute values of its formant frequencies, but on the relationship between the formant frequencies for that vowel and the formant frequencies of other vowels pronounced by that speaker. Six versions of tile sentence Please say what this word is were synthesized on a Parametric Artificial Talking device. Four test words of the form b-(vowel)-t were also synthesized. It is shown that the identification of the test word depends on the formant structure of the introductory sentence.

abstract = {Three speakers read aloud meaningful grammatical English sentences at a fast rate. Some of these sentences contained common maxims and stereotyped phrases. Other sentences which were less familiar contained, in similar phonetic environments, certain test words that also occurred in the stereotyped sentences. The test words were “excised”, i.e., gated out of all the sentences, and listening tests were performed by 43 listeners. Quite apart from these listening tests two operational measures of redundancy were derived. One measure was based on a Markovian model of perception and readers were asked to guess what word n would be after they had read all the words through word n–1 in a sentence. The second measure was based on the hypothesis that people reserve their final decision on the recognition of each word until they perceive an entire sentence. Readers read an entire sentence in the midst of which a word was represented by a dash. They were then asked to guess what the missing word was. Two groups of thirty readers each performed these written tests on the sentences from which the test words had been excised. Indexes of redundancy were computed for each test word from the percent of correct guesses that occurred for the two written tests.The results of the listening tests show that the intelligibility of the excised words is inversely proportional to the redundancy index obtained from the total sentence context. Two acoustic correlates of linguistic stress (duration and amplitude) were measured for each excised word. Stress is also apparently inversely proportional to the sentence context redundancy measure. The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that both the acoustic realization and auditory perception of a given word in a meaningful sentence may be a function of the speaker's and listener's knowledge of the semantic and grammatical information contained in the entire sentence. The experimental results also indicate that, in some circumstances, a listener may be able to identify a word only after he adapts to the speaker's voice.},

We show that severe energetic masking, such as that produced by background speech or noise, curtails reliance on lexical-semantic knowledge and increases relative reliance on salient acoustic detail. In contrast, informational masking, induced by a resource-depleting competing task (divided attention or a memory load), results in the opposite pattern. Based on this clear dissociation, we propose a model of speech recognition that addresses not only the mapping between sensory input and lexical representations, as traditionally advocated, but also the way in which this mapping interfaces with general cognition and non-linguistic processes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The effect of cognitive load (CL) on speech recognition has received little attention despite the prevalence of CL in everyday life, e.g., dual-tasking. To assess the effect of CL on the interaction between lexically-mediated and acoustically-mediated processes, we measured the magnitude of the "Ganong effect" (i.e., lexical bias on phoneme identification) under CL and no CL. CL consisted of a concurrent visual search task. Experiment 1 showed an increased Ganong effect under CL. A time-course analysis of this pattern (Experiments 2 and 3) revealed that the Ganong effect decreased over time under optimal conditions, but it did not under CL. Thus, CL appears to be delaying (and perhaps preventing) listeners' ability to rely on fine phonetic detail to perform the sub-lexical task. This finding, along with an absence of measurable effects at the post-lexical level (Experiment 4) or at the lexical level (Experiment 5) and a clear negative effect of CL on perceptual discrimination (Experiment 6), suggests that the increased reliance on lexically-mediated processes under CL is the cascaded effect of impoverished encoding of the sensory input. Ways of implementing a link between CL and sensory analysis into existing models of speech recognition are proposed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that listeners use lexical knowledge in perceptual learning of speech sounds. Dutch listeners first made lexical decisions on Dutch words and nonwords. The final fricative of 20 critical words had been replaced by an ambiguous sound, between [f] and [s]. One group of listeners heard ambiguous [f]-final words (e.g., [witlo?], from witlof, chicory) and unambiguous [s]-final words (e.g., naaldbos, pine forest). Another group heard the reverse (e.g., ambiguous [na:ldbo?], unambiguous witlof ). Listeners who had heard [?] in [f]-final words were subsequently more likely to categorize ambiguous sounds on an [f]-[s] continuum as [f] than those who heard [?] in [s]-final words. Control conditions ruled out alternative explanations based on selective adaptation and contrast. Lexical information can thus be used to train categorization of speech. This use of lexical information differs from the on-line lexical feedback embodied in interactive models of speech perception. In contrast to on-line feedback, lexical feedback for learning is of benefit to spoken word recognition (e.g., in adapting to a newly encountered dialect). ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Recent studies that used Ganong's (1980) identification task have produced discrepant results. The present study sought to resolve these discrepancies by examining the influence of methodological factors on phoneme identification and differences in data analysis techniques. Three factors were examined across 2 experiments: position of target phoneme, phonetic contrast, and 2 task conditions in which stimulus quality (S/N ratio) or cognitive load varied. A meta-analysis was then performed on the results from all identification studies, including the present one, in an effort to obtain additional insight on factors that influence the task. The experiments and meta-analysis identified the importance of several methodological factors in affecting identification, most notably position of the target phoneme.},

@article{Pitt2006,
abstract = {Many models of spoken word recognition posit the existence of lexical and sublexical representations, with excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms used to affect the activation levels of such representations. Bottom-up evidence provides excitatory input, and inhibition from phonetically similar representations leads to lexical competition. In such a system, long words should produce stronger lexical activation than short words, for 2 reasons: Long words provide more bottom-up evidence than short words, and short words are subject to greater inhibition due to the existence of more similar words. Four experiments provide evidence for this view. In addition, reaction-time-based partitioning of the data shows that long words generate greater activation that is available both earlier and for a longer time than is the case for short words. As a result, lexical influences on phoneme identification are extremely robust for long words but are quite fragile and condition-dependent for short words. Models of word recognition must consider words of all lengths to capture the true dynamics of lexical activation.},

abstract = {Native listeners adapt to noncanonically produced speech by retuning phoneme boundaries by means of lexical knowledge. We asked whether a second language lexicon can also guide category retuning and whether perceptual learning transfers from a second language (L2) to the native language (L1). During a Dutch lexical-decision task, German and Dutch listeners were exposed to unusual pronunciation variants in which word-final /f/ or /s/ was replaced by an ambiguous sound. At test, listeners categorized Dutch minimal word pairs ending in sounds along an /f/-/s/ continuum. Dutch L1 and German L2 listeners showed boundary shifts of a similar magnitude. Moreover, following exposure to Dutch-accented English, Dutch listeners also showed comparable effects of category retuning when they heard the same speaker speak her native language (Dutch) during the test. The former result suggests that lexical representations in a second language are specific enough to support lexically guided retuning, and the latter implies that production patterns in a second language are deemed a stable speaker characteristic likely to transfer to the native language; thus retuning of phoneme categories applies across languages.},
