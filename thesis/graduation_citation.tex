Dr. McAuliffe studied how attention can affect how listeners perceptually adapt to novel talkers.
He found that when attention is explicitly or implicitly directed to a  specific speaker trait, listeners
do not perceptually adapt as much as when attention is not manipulated.
This knowledge will aid in understanding of how cognitive and linguistic processes interact.
Language provides a rich and dynamic interface between an individual and evolving social and cultural situations.
Understanding how humans interact with language will ultimately aid in the creation of better human-computer interfaces
that adapt to us as much as we adapt to them.
