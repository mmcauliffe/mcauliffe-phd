Dr. McAuliffe studied how attention can affect how listeners perceptually adapt to novel talkers.
He found that when attention is explicitly or implicitly directed to a  specific speaker trait, listeners
do not perceptually adapt as much as when attention is not manipulated.
Counter-intuitively, attention to a particular trait inhibits adaptation to it.
